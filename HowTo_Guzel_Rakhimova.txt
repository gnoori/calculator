Instructions to open the java file:

I created the project using NETBEANS:
To run Java File through Command Line, I used Calculator.jar File

1. Download the code
2. Set the java path (if needed): SET PATH = “C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_221\bin”
3. Go to the file location of the file downloaded: cd Calculator/dist/
4. Once you are in the right location where the Calculator.jar File is, then type the following: java -jar Calculator.jar
Explanation of how the Calculator works:
1. Trigonometric functions are running only when you type(press) the number first and then press SIN, COS, TAN, COT, LN, or LOG functions.
2. If the input is invalid – The exception will throw “Invalid Input”. Check the code line 33 and 36.
3. If a negative number is entered, the program can not recognize it. 
In case of failure of failure of executing the file, followings are the screenshots: (see the next page)
